# Wi-Fi Traffic Classification
This repository contains code and resources for classifying Wi-Fi traffic using machine learning techniques. The project aims to identify different types of network traffic based on their characteristics.

## Motivation
During summer, I usually spend some time with my girlfriend, in a remote city in the Italian Alps. We usually rely on a 5G hotspot for internet access, but the connection can be unstable at times. Its performance is fine, but when she turns on her smartphone, it becomes absolutely unusable. The question "What the heck is she looking at?" often comes to mind, and it made me wonder about the nature of the traffic being generated by her device. She truly is an inspiration for this project.

## Environment setup
First of all, my environment is a MacBook Pro M1, running macOS Ventura 13.4.1. I use Homebrew to manage my packages, and I have Python 3.11 installed.

To install the necessary packages and applications for the project:

```bash
brew install wireshark
brew install wireshark-app
```
The difference between `wireshark` and `wireshark-app` is that the former installs the command-line tools, while the latter installs the GUI application. Additional tools that are part of Wireshark CLI are needed for this project.

The `airport` command is deprecated, and the replacement command line tool `wdutil` does not serve the same purpose. Therefore, I had to use the GUI tool Wireless Diagnostics to enable the monitor mode in Wireshark.
```
Wireless Diagnostics -> Window -> Sniffer
```
After selecting the correct channel and bandwidth in the Wireless Diagnostics tool, it's possible to proceed with the capture in Wireshark.

## Capture processing
I did not know the MAC address of the target device beforehand, so I had to capture the traffic for a while. Once I had enough data, I stopped the capture and saved the file in `.pcapng` format.

I filtered it later with the `tshark` command, creating a new capture file:
```bash
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "wlan.fc.type==2 && (wlan.addr==AA:AA:AA:BB:BB:BB)" -w filtered_data.pcap
```
This command allows me to filter the captured packets based on two specific criteria, like the frame type and the MAC address of the target device.

For the first part of the project, that does not involve machine learning, I focused on analyzing the filtered capture file to understand the characteristics of the Wi-Fi traffic generated by the target device. It was pretty handy to export it as a CSV and process it later with MATLAB.
