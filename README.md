# Wi-Fi Traffic Classification
This repository contains code and resources for classifying Wi-Fi traffic using machine learning techniques. The project aims to identify different types of network traffic based on their characteristics.

## Motivation
During summer, I usually spend some time with my girlfriend, in a remote city in the Italian Alps. We usually rely on a 5G hotspot for internet access, but the connection can be unstable at times. Its performance is fine, but when she turns on her smartphone, it becomes absolutely unusable. The question "What the heck is she looking at?" often comes to mind, and it made me wonder about the nature of the traffic being generated by her device. She truly is an inspiration for this project.

## Environment setup
First of all, my environment is a MacBook Pro M1, running macOS Ventura 13.4.1. I use Homebrew to manage my packages, and I have Python 3.11 installed. The `airport` command is deprecated, and the replacement command line tool `wdutil` does not serve the same purpose. Therefore, I had to use the GUI tool Wireless Diagnostics to capture the Wi-Fi traffic.
```
Wireless Diagnostics -> Window -> Sniffer
```
From here, we can proceed with the Wireshark capture.
